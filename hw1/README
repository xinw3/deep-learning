############### Code for Homework1 Problem 6 (xinw3) ##############
1. To execute the code, please type "python p6.py -[problem letter]".
Replace [problem letter] with "a", "b", "c", "g", "h", which correspond to the problems

Example: python p6.py -a

2. For d), e) and f), if you want to try different parameters,
just open p6.py, find them at the beginning and change to the parameters you want.

I don't have too much time to make them into arguments that can be passed
using command line.

3. For i), if you want to see the performance of different activation function,
just type "python p6.py -g --activation [activation function]".
Replace the [activation function] with "sigmoid", "tanh", "relu".

Without specification of the activation function, the code will run in sigmoid
activation function by default.

Example: python p6.py -g --activation tanh
