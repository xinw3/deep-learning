############### Code for hw2 Problem 5 (xinw3) ##############
1. To execute the code, please type "python hw2p5.py -[problem letter]".
Replace [problem letter] with the follows:

"a": Problem 5 a).

     If you want to run b), please replace the variable "cd_steps" in the beginning
     to the different steps

"c": Problem 5 c).

     Sampling from RBM model

"d": Problem 5 d).

     Only for the neural nets with pretrained weights using RBM

"e": Problem 5 e) Visualizing weights

     For visualizing the weights pretrained using Autoencoder

"e2": Problem 5 e) Classification error

     For training neural nets with weights obtained from standard Autoencoder

"f": Problem 5 f) Visualizing weights

     For visualizing the weights pretrained using Denoising Autoencoder

"f2": Problem 5 f) Classification error

     For training neural nets with weights obtained from standard Autoencoder


Example: python hw2p5.py -a

2. You may change the tunable parameters in the beginning of the hw2p5.py.
   For the variables of the neural nets, please change it at the beginning of d()
