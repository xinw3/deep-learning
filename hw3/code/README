######### Below is the commands for answering questions in write-up #########

# train the language model
## linear (directly change parameters inside of the file)
python p32.py

## tanh (directly change parameters inside of the file)
python p33.py

# draw plots from the output of the terminal in the case that running
# on some virtual machine and cannot display plots directly
cat p32_lr01_h128.txt | python plots_from_terminal.py

# problem 3.4
# Note that if it's the first time to run p34.py, which means the params haven't
# been written to the files, comment out the 'NOTE' part in main to get the best
# parameters first. Because I have already written the parameters into 'weights.pickle'
# and 'biases.pickle' so it's ok for you to just run the code

python p34.py
